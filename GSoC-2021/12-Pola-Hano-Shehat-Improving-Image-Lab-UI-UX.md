### Project Abstract
ImageLab is a standalone tool which supports anyone to get started with image processing related concepts and techniques in an interactive, less logical way. So, this tool enables and also motivates the fresh users to understand how image processing concepts work by interacting with ImageLab. Moreover, for the users who are already comfortable with image processing tasks ImageLab offers a test environment before they move ahead with actual implementation or development.

### Work Summary

The main idea of the project that I chose to work on is enhancing UI / UX of the project. So, I started before the GSoC begins and designed my initial imagination about the project UI and thinked how to improve it to get user satisfactory. After thinking I listed points to follow to get better UI. I started building a new UI from scratch and through my work I gained much experience in technologies I have never used and by time with consulting of my mentors the project got better and better.It was a great learning journey.
